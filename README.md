# Sudoku-Solver-Project
Reads a text file set up as a Sudoku puzzle and recursively solves it for the user through a GUI.

The .cpp sourcecode simply starts the form code, where most of the program is run, in SudokuForm.h.
For Windows Form in C++ the code must be in unmanaged code, which is the case in SudokuForm.h.
